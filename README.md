# Borkify
A Sigil plugin to 'Borkify' an ePUB. What it effectively does is irreversibly change the text in the ePUB. This can be useful if you have an issue with a book and someone else wants to look at it but you are not allowed to distribute. As the changes are irreversible, the text is useless for reading and therefore it usually can be shared.

Upon the first execution a configuration file will be created. TIn one of four options can be set:
0. Each text element will have a random method of 'borkifation'
1. Swedish Chef (default)
2. Elmer Fudd
3. Olde English
